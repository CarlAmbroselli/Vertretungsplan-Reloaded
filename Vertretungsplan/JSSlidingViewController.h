// SLIDING SCROLL VIEW DISCUSSION
 
// Nota Bene:
// Some of these scroll view delegate method implementations may look quite strange, but
// it has to do with the peculiarities of the timing and circumstances of UIScrollViewDelegate
// callbacks. Numerous bugs and unusual edge cases have been accounted for via rigorous testing.
// Edit them with extreme care, at your own risk.
//
// How It Works:
//
// 1. The slidingScrollView is a container for the frontmost content. The backmost content is not a part of the
// slidingScrollView's hierarchy. The slidingScrollView has a clear background color, which masks the technique I'm using.
// To make it easier to see what's happening, try temporarily setting it's background color to a semi-translucent color
// in the -(void)setupSlidingScrollView method.
//
// 2. When the slider is closed and at rest, the scroll view's frame fills the display.
//
// 3. When the slider is open and at rest, the scroll view's frame is snapped over to the right,
// starting at an x origin of 262.
//
// 4. When the slider is being opened or closed and is tracking a dragging touch, the scroll view's frame fills
// the display.
//
// 5a. When the slider has finished animating/decelerating to either the closed or open position, the
// UIScrollView delegate callbacks are used to determine what to do next.
// 5b. If the slider has come to rest in the open position, the scroll view's frame's x origin is set to the value
// in #3, and an "invisible button" is added over the visible portion of the main content
// to catch touch events and trigger a close action.
// 5c. If the slider has come to rest in the closed position, the invisible button is removed, and the
// scroll view's frame once again fills the display.
//
// 6. Numerous edge cases were solved for, most of them related to what happens when touches/drags
// begin or end before the slider has finished decelerating (in either direction).
//
// 7a. Changes to the scroll view frame or the invisible button are also triggered by UIView touch event
// methods like touchesBegan and touchesEnded.
// 7b. Since not every touch sequence turns into a drag, responses to these touch events must perform
// some of the same functions as responses to scroll view delegate methods. This explains why there is
// some overlap between the two kinds of sequences.
//
// Summary:
//
// By combining UIScrollViewDelegate methods and UIView touch event methods, I am able to mimic the slide-to-reveal
// navigation that is currently in-vogue, but without having to manually track touches and calculate dragging & decelerating
// animations. Apple's own implementation of UIScrollView touch tracking is infinitely smoother and richer than any
// third party library.
